# Introduction

CrystalSub is a subdomain discovery tool that discovers valid subdomains for websites by using passive online sources. It has a simple modular architecture and is optimized for speed. CrystalSub is built for doing one thing only - passive subdomain enumeration, and it does that very well.

It can run faster using the CrystalSub thread module.

By default it is set to 10 threads.

Note: Giving more than 30 threads will cause the program to break ..!
